React is flexible and can be used in a variety of projects. You can create new apps with it, but you can also gradually introduce it into an existing codebase without doing a rewrite.

## Trying Out React

If you're just interested in playing around with React, you can use CodePen. Try starting from [this Hello World example code](http://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/rrpgNB?editors=0010). You don't need to install anything; you can just modify the code and see if it works.

If you prefer to use your own text editor, you can also [download this HTML file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/master/static/html/single-file-example.html), edit it, and open it from the local filesystem in your browser. It does a slow runtime code transformation, so don't use it in production.
