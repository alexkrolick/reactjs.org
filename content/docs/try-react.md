Try React online or set up your local development environment.

## Online

If you're just interested in playing around with React, you can use an online code playground. Try a Hello World template on [CodePen](codepen://hello-world) or [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s).

## Minimal HTML Template

If you prefer to use your own text editor, you can also [download this HTML file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/master/static/html/single-file-example.html), edit it, and open it from the local filesystem in your browser. It does a slow runtime code transformation, so don't use it in production.

## Next Steps

### Quick Start

- Head over to the [Quick Start](/docs/hello-world.html) section for a step-by-step introduction to React concepts.

- Try the [Tutorial](/tutorial/tutorial.html) for a hands-on practical example.

### Complete Development Environment

If you are ready to build a full application with React, check out the install guides. These setups are designed to get you up and running with a great developer experience and a production-ready setup with linting, testing, and optimizations built-in; however, they require more time to set up and install. The lighter-weight solutions above are the best fit if you are new to React or just experimenting.
