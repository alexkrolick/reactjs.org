Try React online or set up your local dev environment

## Online

If you're just interested in playing around with React, you can use an online code playground. Try a Hello World template on [CodePen](codepen://hello-world) or [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s).

## HTML Template

If you prefer to use your own text editor, you can also [download this HTML file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/master/static/html/single-file-example.html), edit it, and open it from the local filesystem in your browser. It does a slow runtime code transformation, so don't use it in production.

## Install React

- **[Add React to a New App](/docs/add-react-to-a-new-app.html)** Create a new app with a starter kit like [Create React App].(http://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
- **[Add React to an Existing App](/docs/add-react-to-a-new-app.html)** _Advanced configuration._ Use React with a build system like Webpack.

## Quick Start

When you're up and running, head over to the [Quick Start](/docs/hello-world.html) section to try some examples.
